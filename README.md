## Database Design

### Schema Overview
Kashida uses a normalized schema design for scalability and performance. Key models include:

- **User**: Stores user information, including profile details, followers, and joined spaces.
- **Post**: Represents user-created posts, including content and associated likes.
- **Comment**: Manages comments on posts with optional images.
- **Reply**: Tracks replies to comments.
- **Follow**: Handles user relationships.
- **Likes**: Separate schemas for posts, comments, and replies to ensure scalability.

### Example Schema: User
```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: { type: String, unique: true },
  password: String,
  joinedSpaces: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'Category' }],
});
```

### Referencing vs. Embedding

**Why Referencing?**
- Optimized performance by avoiding large embedded arrays.
- Simplifies relationship handling (e.g., user follows, likes).
- Flexible and scalable for growing datasets.

## Controllers

### Modular Design
Controllers manage application logic and ensure seamless interaction between the frontend and the database.

#### Example: Post Controller
- **Create Post**
   ```javascript
   exports.createPost = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
     const post = await Post.create(req.body);
     res.status(201).json({ status: 'success', data: { post } });
   });
   ```
- **Like Post**
   Handles user likes with a dedicated PostLikes schema for scalability.

### Global Error Handler
Centralized error handling ensures consistent responses across all endpoints.

---

## Routes

### Organized Structure
Routes are divided by functionality:
- `/api/users`: User management (signup, login, profile updates).
- `/api/posts`: Post creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion.
- `/api/comments`: Comment and reply management.
- `/api/likes`: Like/unlike actions for posts, comments, and replies.
- `/api/follow`: Manage follow relationships.

### Example Route
```javascript
const postRouter = express.Router();
postRouter.route('/').get(postController.getAllPosts).post(authController.protect, postController.createPost);
```

---

## Utility Functions

### Key Utilities

1. **catchAsync**
   - Simplifies error handling in asynchronous functions.
2. **AppError**
   - Custom error class for consistent error management.
3. **APIFeatures**
   - Enables filtering, sorting, pagination, and more for API responses.
4. **Cloudinary Configuration**
   - Handles efficient image uploads and deletions.

---

## Performance Optimization

- **Normalization**: Separate schemas for relationships and interactions.
- **Pagination**: Efficient data retrieval for large datasets.
- **Caching**: Reduced redundant queries.
- **Middleware**: Pre-validation for routes to reduce load on controllers.

## Examples

### Create a New Post
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/posts`
```json
{
  "title": "Mastering Thuluth Script",
